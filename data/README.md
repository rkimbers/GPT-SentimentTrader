This version of the process_articles function uses the NLTK library to tokenize the article content into words, remove punctuation and stop words, perform part of speech tagging, and then extract only the nouns. The processed content is then the string of nouns joined back together. This will enhance the analyze_sentiment function by focusing it on the entities mentioned in the articles.
