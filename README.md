# GPT-SentimentTrader

GPT-SentimentTrader is a Python-based trading bot that employs sentiment analysis techniques using OpenAI's GPT models on news articles to guide trading decisions. This bot was built with the intent to leverage various APIs to compare AI trading to major index preformance. More info about the project's goals are below.

## Project Overview

The bot operates through a sequence of actions that include fetching articles from the internet, performing sentiment analysis using the GPT model, implementing a trading strategy based on the sentiment scores, and executing trades via the Alpaca Markets API.

The project is structured in the following way:

## Modules
Each directory contains modules that fulfill specific functions within the bot:

| Directory | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [my_openai](/my_openai)               | This directory contains the `sentiment_analysis.py` module, which interacts with OpenAI's GPT-3.5 API to analyze the sentiment of news articles. |
| [my_alpaca](/my_alpaca)               | The `trading.py` module in this directory manages all interactions with the Alpaca API. It is responsible for executing trading decisions made by the bot. |
| [my_twilio](/my_twilio)               | The `messaging.py` module in this directory interacts with the twilio API, providing trade notifications via SMS. |
| [data](/data)                         | This directory houses two modules. `fetch_articles.py` fetches articles from the internet, and `process_articles.py` preprocesses these articles to prepare them for sentiment analysis. |
| [database](/database)                 | This directory houses the SQLite3 database manager, `db_manager.py` which acts as a wrapper for the articles.db file found in the root directory. Its purpose is to store data before trades are executed  |
| [models](/models)                     | This directory includes the `trading_strategy.py`, `finance_utils.py`, and the `account_utils.py` modules which house the bot's trading strategy, and provide utility getter functions for other areas of the applicaion. |
| [main.py](/main.py)                   | The main script that ties all the modules together to enable the bot's functionality. |
| [requirements.txt](/requirements.txt) | The file containing the list of dependencies and libraries required for the project. |
| [Dockerfile](/Dockerfile)             | The Dockerfile containing instructions to build this application to a container. |
| [License](/LICENSE)                   | Self explanitory. More details about GPT-SentimentTrader's license below. |

## Setup & Installation

To set up and run GPT-BasedTradingBot on your local machine, follow these steps:

Note that this will soon be outdated as the application will soon be containerized

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/rkimbers/GPT-SentimentTrader.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd GPT-SentimentTrader`
3. Install the required Python packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Update the required API keys in your `.env` file

## Usage

Run the bot by executing the main script: `python main.py` The bot will scrape news articles and analyze their sentiment every 10 minutes. The bot will then take the calculated sentiment and execute trades every Monday at market open. The bot also has support for immediate orders, which are placed in succession to the sentiment analysis, if needed.

## Dependencies

GPT-SentimentTrader implements an array of Python packages:

- OpenAI's GPT for sentiment analysis
- Alpaca's API for executing trades
- Alpha Vantage's API for finance utilities. I use the '75 requests/min' tier currently
- BeautifulSoup and Requests for fetching and parsing web articles
- Selenium for scraping dynamic content, such as artilce URLs
- Twilio's API for SMS interactions.


## Contributions

## Goals

This project was created with the intent to learn the interaction with OpenAI's API and see just how powerful it can be. I also want to learn more about the SDLC and how to ship software. One thing I've never truly done before is properly and "professionally" document my code with README's and comments. I want to give that a shot this time around. Before I started this project, I realized it has been way too long for me to keep waiting to mess around with GPT models. This project throws me into the crossroads of 2 of my biggest interests, computer science and finance. Now, it's time to figure out how to implement math. 

This project was NOT created with the expectation of being profitable. If you fork this repository and run this application on your own, please carry the same expectation. I am only responsible for financial gain. I am not responsible for financial loss.
